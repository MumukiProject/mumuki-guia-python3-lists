As you can see, it's possible to represent lists of numbers or booleans in the same way: they're enclosed in square brackets and separated by commas. We can have lists of numbers, strings, booleans, and so on. We can even create lists of lists! :exploding_head:

```python
lottery_numbers = [2, 11, 17, 32, 36, 39]
die_rolls = [1, 6, 6, 2, 2, 4]
was_heads = [False, False, True, False]
list_of_lists = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]
```
