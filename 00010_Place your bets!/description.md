But can we only create lists of strings? What if you want to represent, say, last week's lottery numbers? Or the successive rolls of the dice? :game_die: Or if consecutive coin tosses came up heads or tails? :thinking:

> Can you imagine how to represent such situations? Take some time to guess it and then try the following expressions in the console:

>``` python
ムlottery_numbers
```
>
> ``` python
ムcoin_flips
```
>
> ``` python
ムdie_rolls
```
>
> ``` python
ムlist_of_lists
```
