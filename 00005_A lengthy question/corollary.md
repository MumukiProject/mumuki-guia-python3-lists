Brilliant! :grin:

We already know that calling `len` with a string gives us its number of characters. Calling it with a list gives us the number of elements. 

And like when counting strings' characters, it doesn't care if the items are distinct or duplicated:

>``` python
ムlen([14, 98, 56, 78])
4
ムlen([4, 4, 5, 4])
4
```

In other words, lists preserve both the order and repetition of their elements. Lists are incredible. :heart_eyes:
