Suppose we want to represent the set of our favorite series. How can we do that?

```python
ana_favorite_series = ["Strappare lungo i bordi", "Bojack Horseman", "Attack on Titan"]
hector_favorite_series  = ["Black Mirror", "Breaking Bad", "3%", "The Queen's Gambit"]
```

As you can see, to represent a group of strings, we place all them between square brackets (`[` and `]`) separated by commas. Easy, right?

> Try the following expressions in the console:
>
>``` python
ムana_favorite_series
```
>
>``` python
ムhector_favorite_series
```
>
>``` python
ム["hello", "world!"]
```
>
>``` python
ム["hello", "hello"]
```
> Look at each of the results and count how many strings are in each list
