rules:
- when:
    these_tests_failed:
    - Medals are not shifted
  then: 'your medals are shifted! You are returning `"silver"` for the first place
    :first_place:  (instead of `"gold"`) and `"bronze"` for the second :second_place:
    (instead of `"silver"`). Don''t forget that indexes in Python start at `0`, not
    `1`'
