:warning: As you've probably noticed, the order of the items is important. For example, `["hello", "world"]` is not the same as `["world", "hello"]`: they both have the same elements, but in different positions.

:relieved: Thus, for two lists to be equal, it is not enough to have the same elements, but it is necessary that they are in exactly the same order.
