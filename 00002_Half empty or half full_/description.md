Cool, it looks like a list can contain items of any type! We can have lists of booleans, numbers, strings, lists... And not only that, but they can also contain any number of elements: one, two, fifteen, a hundred! :flushed:

Could we then also have empty lists, that is, a list that contains no elements? :face_with_monocle:
